This is a personal blog about things I'm working on or have otherwise found to be interesting. The main goal of the blog is to become more fluent in writing Swedish, English, and soon also Japanese.

The blog itself is generated by-, and hosted on [GitHub] [github]. This is done through the static site generator [Jekyll] [jekyll].

You can find the source code on the [GitHub repository page] [self_repo], and unless stated otherwise, all content is licensed under the [MIT License] [self_license].
